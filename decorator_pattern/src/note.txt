How works this pattern
==========================

Need to decorate object
========================

My Current object is BasicCar, I need to modified as SuperCar

1) Want to update/decorate my Basic car as SuperCar

Set the object in constructor

create object of SuperCar and pass BasicCar object as reference
Call super class constructor and pass  BasicCar object

Call the methods

Call SuperCar method, inside call parent class method
Parent(Super)class method will call BasicCar method

Supercar class method will return Basic car object with existing functionality

Supercar  class will call addPattern() method and decorate BasicCar object
